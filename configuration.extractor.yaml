# Note: Since the introduction of workspaces we recommend using workspaces instead of using this file to inform apiops about extracting select artifacts instead of extracting everything. 
# We are keeping support for this file as not everyone will be able to use workspaces.
# More information about workspaces can be found here https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/workspaces-overview
